# TODO: Filter to check only the ones still waiting for response. Harder than I initially thought,
# I think the best way is check described_state = 'waiting_response' and awaiting_description = false.
# Unless I'm wrong any other combination means something arrived. Now, the user could classify the
# response as 'I'm still waiting', in which case it's probably wasteful to recheck - because I think
# Irekia only replies once - but maybe it's more robust like this.
# In the meantime I'm ignoring requests that have responses already when fetching responses. Note that
# this relies on the assumption that Irekia replies only once ever.
